ConditionParser
===============

with threads

The second home work app

For start please call main method from class:
ConditionParser / src / ru / gn29 / conditionparser / Main.java

It's better to download project and start from eclipse because of inner txt recourse file "dekorat.txt" (in the root folder of this project) or modify the line 19 in ConditionParser / src / ru / gn29 / conditionparser / ThreadForPuttingWords.java where the file is written.
